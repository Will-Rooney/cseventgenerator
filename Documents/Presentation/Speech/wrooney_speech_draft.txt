Amazon's Web Services (AWS) is an end-to-end solution for the management of applications and data on the cloud. We use a montioring service on AWS called Cloudwatch to observe general system events, specifically changes to instances (web applications).

We process these events and use the data to dynamically update Cisco's reverse proxy. We have built a simulation to better help demonstrate how our project works:

Our project automates a simple task. This is the automation most think of: the kind that eliminates jobs. It eliminates a step that adds no quality to the development of Cisco products in and of itself.
