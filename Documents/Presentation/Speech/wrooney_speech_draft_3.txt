Slide 1:
Amazon's Web Services (AWS) is an end-to-end solution for the management of applications and data on the cloud. Using Amazon's monitoring service called CloudWatch we can observe general system events, specifically we observe changes to instances which host web applications.

Slide 2:
We process these changes and use the data to dynamically update Cisco's reverse proxy.

Slide 3:
We have built a simulation to help demonstrate how our project works: [Demo]
The simulations consists of two parts.
The Event Generator, which simulates events that we have configured on AWS to send instance changes to the reverse proxy.
This tool is primarily used for testing so that we don't actually have to run or tear down instances on AWS.
Then we have our server which simulates the behavior of Ciscoâ€™s reverse proxy.
For our simulation, the events generated by the Event Generator are handled by this server.

Slide 4:
Our project automates a simple task. This is not the automation most think of: the kind that eliminates jobs. It eliminates a step that adds no quality to the development of Cisco products.
